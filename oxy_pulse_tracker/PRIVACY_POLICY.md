# Oxy Pulse Tracker: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Oxy Pulse Tracker app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Md Sultan Altamash Ali. The source code is available on GitHub; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an professional software engineer, I understand the importance of data privacy. I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences,  medical observations, member details or any other data) created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. There is no use of internet in this application and thus data won't be shared with anyone in any case.

As you can see in `oxy_pulse_tracker/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, we are not asking any permission as data is being saved in the device.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Md Sultan Altamash Ali
