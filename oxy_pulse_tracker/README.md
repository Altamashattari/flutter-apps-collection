Oxy Pulse Tracker is an offline application to keep track of body vitals for you, your family members, or your patients. It provides a clean and easy user interface to add multiple members and track their Oxygen Saturation, Pulse rate, and body temperature. The user needs to manually enter these observations. Users can see data in a well-organized tabular format and can export it as a PDF file. Users can edit the existing log, delete the existing log, and can sort data based on date and observation values. This application stores data in the user's device and data privacy is totally secured as we don't share data with anyone and data is stored offline in the user's device.
